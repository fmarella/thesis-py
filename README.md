Work in progress

This is a port of my thesis work from R to Python using the scikit-learn library.

Thesis: Prediction of Fault-Prone Software Modules.

Abstract: Evaluated the prediction performaces of Naive Bayes, SVM and k-Nearest Neighbor using the datasets from the NASA Metrics Data Program (MDP)
repository. Applied the Principal Component Analisys (PCA) to extract the principal components. Compared the prediction performances with the full set of
attributes and a subset of the principal components.
